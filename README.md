# Mini Minecraft
 
This is a Minecraft-like game, using OpenGL and C++ . We didn't use any game engine for this game. All the visual effects are built from OpenGL and Qt.

Specifically, I mainly implemented following features in this game:

- Procedural Terrain
- Texturing and Texture Animation
- Mutiple Biomes Supported(Grassland, Desert, Mountain, Snowfield)
- Procedurally Placed Assets
- Procedural Buildings with Shape Grammars(L-System)
